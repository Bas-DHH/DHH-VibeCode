# Development Guidelines
- Use PHP 8.3+ features where appropriate
- Follow Laravel conventions and best practices
- Use Eloquent ORM and FormRequest validation
- Use Inertia for controller-to-component communication (no REST API)
- Use TypeScript in React components
- Use shadcn/ui for all UI elements (e.g., <Button>, <Card>, <Dialog>, etc.)
- Use Tailwind utility classes for layout and spacing
- Use Laravel Breeze or Jetstream for auth scaffolding
- Admin creates users manually (no invite flow or self-registration)

# Coding Standards

# Business Rules
- Tasks belong to fixed categories (e.g., Temperature Control, Goods Receiving)
- Daily tasks regenerate each day
- Overdue tasks must be marked clearly (e.g., red badge via <Badge variant="destructive">)
- Only one location per business in MVP
- Manual task creation must be available
- No image uploads in MVP
- Use email/password login with "remember me" option

# Design System
- Primary color: #5095cc
- Use class names like `bg-primary`, `text-primary`, `hover:bg-primary/90`
- Layouts must be mobile-first and responsive

# Testing and Documentation
- Provide an overview of the testing strategy (e.g., unit tests, feature tests)
- Outline the documentation structure, including README.md, usage examples, and API references

# Misc
- Avoid overengineering: prioritize speed and usability
- When in doubt, follow Laravel conventions
- No REST API unless absolutely required â€” use Inertia
